This branch of the repository contains the code of an `Android` application that allows you to recieve a video stream from an `Android` device with a client part of the software.

This software allows you to display the received video stream in four images rotated relative to each other by 90 degrees, which will allow using an inverted truncated pyramid placed in the center of the screen of an `Android` device to display the video stream as a hologram.
